This is a repository to work in the  "Monster game" project. 2DAW WD CLIENT SIDE IES Maria Enriquez 2021
NONE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:

    Create a brand new repository in GITHUB for the project.
        Add my github user (xavi12p) as member of your repository
    There is a due date to deliver the project. There is a second date (cut-off date) to deliver it, but you will receive a penalization for each day missed from the due date. (5 points over 100).
    In case of fatal errors, the project will be returned to the student to fix the fatal errors. Every time the project is returned, you will be penalized with 10 points (over 100).
    Split your code in layers: UI & Business Logic. You can use the MVC pattern.
        The UI layer will be responsible of the User Interface
        The Business Logic layer will be responsible of the Core Game (the business rules of the game).
            You must decouple any UI call from the Business Logic Layer
    Use as many theoretical concepts as possible. The more you use, the better grade you will get.
    All the configuration game values, like for example the player's health or the min/max attack, must be coded once in the code only.
    All the configuration game values must be easily located in the code.
    Write DRY code (DRY stands for: Don't Repeat Yourself)
    Name the variables and functions in english
    Comment out your code in english
    The project must run in Firefox
    The project must run in the VSCode LiveServer
    The code must be formatted as per the Javascript best practices.
    The application cannot raise any error in the console.
    Only the requested log info must appear in the console. Any debug information must be removed.
    Test the Business Logic with JEST
    Don't use languages structures/concepts that you have not covered yet in the course.

IMPORTANT:
If there are two projects where the source code is very similar (50% equal or more), both students will be graded with a 0. An anti copy software will be used to detect such situations.

DELIVERABLES:

    You must just push your changes to your brand new repository and post the SSH or HTTPS github links.
